Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

 

Example 1:
<<<<<<< HEAD
```
(Figure 1)

=======
(Figure 1)
```
>>>>>>> c3afcc4e59806f030e04490340e415c62595ca3b
Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: l1 = [], l2 = []
Output: []
```
Example 3:
```
Input: l1 = [], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
 ```

Constraints:
```
The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
Both l1 and l2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
```
