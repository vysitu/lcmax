Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

 

Example 1:
(Figure 1)
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```
Example 2:
(Figure 1)
```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
```
Example 3:
```
Input: head = []
Output: []
 ```

Constraints:
```
The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000
 ```

Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

# 解法
这个有空可以探讨一下。我觉得似乎直接涉及到链表的创建了。可能又要看别人答案了。
