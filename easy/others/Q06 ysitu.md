Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```
Example 4:
```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: 1
Explanation: n = 1 since there is 1 number, so all numbers are in the range [0,1]. 1 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
 ```

Constraints:
```
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 104
0 <= nums[i] <= n
All the numbers of nums are unique.
 ```

# 解法
一种比较直观且省事的方法是先排序，再一个个的找过去，找到对不上的就直接返回。

# Python3
```python3
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        n = len(nums)
        if nums[-1] != n-1:
            for idx in range(n):
                if idx != nums[idx]:
                    return(idx)
        else:
            return(nums[-1]+1)
